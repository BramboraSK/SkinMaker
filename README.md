# SkinMaker
 
## About

Skin Maker is a simple tool that aims to help people who create skins for osu!. It (will) provides tools that can help you organize, create and edit specific files in skin. Our main goal is to save skinners' time and make editing files (such as skin.ini) more user friendly.

## How to use

Skin Maker is currently in a very early state of development and the only feature it currently has is opening .png/.jpg files with selected application (Photoshop, GIMP, ...). We are working hard to add bunch of new epic features!
